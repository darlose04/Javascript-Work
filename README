This repository contains Javascript files that I have created and worked on in order to learn and gain a better understanding of the language. A lot of these will be similar to the Python scripts in my Python-Scripts repository. Using the logic of the Python scripts helps me learn the syntax of a new language.

bigDiff.js: Returns the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in an array.

countEvens.js: Takes a given array and returns a new array made up of the even numbers from the given array.

countString.js: Counts the number of words in a string.

countVowels.js: Counts the number of each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) as well as the total number of vowels.

tempConversions.js: Consists of two functions, one which converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit and one which converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.

reverseString.js: Contains two separate functions that reverse a given string. One function uses .split().reverse().join() and the other function turns the string into an array, loops through it backwards, and then pushes it to a new array.  

factorial.js: Function that returns the factorial value of a given number.
